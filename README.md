This repository contains code used for an assignment I completed as part of the MSc Data Analytics from UCD for the module "Bayesian Analysis". I received an A+ grade for this assignment.

In this assigment, I was tasked with fitting a Bayesian Linear Regression model to the Kung-San data and to use the posterior model to estimate the expected heights of a subset of the Kung San data set based on their weights. I also estimate credible intervals for the mean heights and posterior prediction intervals for the predicted heights. Throughout this assignment, I created STAN files to fit the Bayesian models and R-markdown to compile the various analyses and produce the final report.

The "Kung San" dataset contains height (cm), weight (kg), age (years) and gender information about the Kung San people who live in the Kalahari desert. The data was collated by Nancy Howell between August 1967 and May 1969.
